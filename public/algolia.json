For example, how much do people dislike traffic on their street can be measured by decrease in house prices in response to increase in street traffic. The statistical technique most commonly used to answer causal questions is the linear regression [1]\rY=βX+Cγ+ϵ Y = \\beta X + C\\gamma + \\epsilon Y=βX+Cγ+ϵ where CCC is the matrix of control variables and we assume that standard OLS assumption holds. However, even when XXX and YYY are causally related, the estimate of β\\betaβ is unbiased only if XXX and ϵ\\epsilonϵ are independent conditioned on CCC. This is often not the case in practice. In our example, he construction of a new housing development in a neighborhood may increase traffic prices while lowering the house prices, but this decrease in …","date":1760705340,"dir":"post\\","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":800,"html":" ","keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1760705340,"objectID":"60ab98d544987cdaf1aa483a4832564f","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/iv_traffic_houseprices/","publishdate":"2025-10-17T18:19:00+05:30","readingtime":4,"relpermalink":"/post/iv_traffic_houseprices/","section":"post","tags":["empirics","externality"],"title":"IV method with application to traffic and house prices","type":"post","url":"/post/iv_traffic_houseprices/","weight":0,"wordcount":754}]
