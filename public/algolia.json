In this post, I summarize the recent research on this topic by Professors Daron Acemoglu, Pascal Restrepo, and their co-authors [[1,2,3,4]].\nHistorically, automation has contributed to job creation and improvements in living standards. However, recent trends have triggered growing concerns about whether this beneficial pattern will continue. By employing a task-based framework, we can better understand automation’s impact by breaking it down into distinct channels—some detrimental to workers (such as job displacement), and others beneficial (including increased productivity and the creation of new tasks). Grasping these mechanisms is vital for evaluating how the AI revolution might reshape the labor market.\nTo analyze these effects, I will present an intuitive explanation of these key …","date":1764938940,"dir":"post\\","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":4300,"html":"A economic analysis of how AI and automation affect labor markets, featuring a task-based framework by Acemoglu and Restrepo.","keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1764938940,"objectID":"b95da688b11c23ff0fadef01de83c28e","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/automation_task/","publishdate":"2025-12-05T18:19:00+05:30","readingtime":20,"relpermalink":"/post/automation_task/","section":"post","tags":["automation","AI"],"title":"Automation, AI, and the Future of Work: Insights from Economics","type":"post","url":"/post/automation_task/","weight":0,"wordcount":4240},{"author":null,"categories":["Economics"],"content":"Instrumental Variable approach for Casual Inference If we believe that a variable XXX causes (or affects) another variable YYY, we are often interested in studying how much the value of YYY changes if we make a small δx\\delta xδx change in XXX. For example, how much do people dislike traffic on their street can be measured by decrease in house prices in response to increase in street traffic. The statistical technique most commonly used to answer causal questions is the linear regression [1]\rY=βX+Cγ+ϵ Y = \\beta X + C\\gamma + \\epsilon Y=βX+Cγ+ϵ where CCC is the matrix of control variables and we assume that standard OLS assumption holds. However, even when XXX and YYY are causally related, the estimate of β\\betaβ is unbiased only if XXX and ϵ\\epsilonϵ are independent conditioned on CCC. This is often not the case in practice. In our example, he construction of a new housing development in a neighborhood may increase traffic prices while lowering the house prices, but this decrease in …","date":1760705340,"dir":"post\\","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":800,"html":" ","keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1760705340,"objectID":"60ab98d544987cdaf1aa483a4832564f","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/iv_traffic_houseprices/","publishdate":"2025-10-17T18:19:00+05:30","readingtime":4,"relpermalink":"/post/iv_traffic_houseprices/","section":"post","tags":["empirics","externality"],"title":"IV method and its application to traffic's impact on house prices","type":"post","url":"/post/iv_traffic_houseprices/","weight":0,"wordcount":751},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":"This is my blog about data analysis and economics.\n","date":1760659200,"dir":"\\","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1760659200,"objectID":"6083a88ee3411b0d17ce02d738f69d47","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/about/","publishdate":"2025-10-17T00:00:00Z","readingtime":1,"relpermalink":"/about/","section":"","tags":null,"title":"About","type":"page","url":"/about/","weight":0,"wordcount":9}]
